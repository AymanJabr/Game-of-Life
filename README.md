# GAME OF LIFE

Implementation of the famous Conway's 'Game of Life' program. This projects aims to solve the following Extendi code Kata: https://github.com/extendi/game-of-life

The goal of the game is to simulate a population of cells/beings, where each cell can be alive or dead. The cells can change from alive to dead and vice verse on each generation. The rules are as follows:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
